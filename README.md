# Swim Team Management System

### Description:
Here is a project I developed as my mini semester project in C++. This project is focused on a team managment system for a swim team, so it is named “Swim Team Management System”.

### Functions:
createSwimmer() - add new swimmer to team;
updateSwimmer() - update a current swimmer on the team;
viewSwimmer() - returns the details of a current swimmer on the team;
viewTeam() - returns the list of current swimmers on the team;
removeSwimmer() - remove a current swimmer on the team;
numberOfSwimmers() - returns the current number of swimmers on the team;
sortByStroke() - sorts swimmers by their best swim stroke
